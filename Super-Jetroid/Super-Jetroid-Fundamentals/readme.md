#  :video_game: Super Jetroid Fundamentals :video_game:

Super Jetroid is a 2D action-adventure game created using the Unity game engine, and it is the first video game that I've created. Super Jetroid Fundamentals was the first step in creating the final version of the game. It helped me to understand the interface of the Unity game engine and the fundamentals of game development.

I created this game through follow the LinkedIn learning course which name is "Unity 5: 2D Building an Adventure Game". Although this course follow Unity 5, I used the latest version of Unity and optimized the game for the latest version of the game engine.

## The scope of the course included
 <ul>
  <li>Creating a new scene</li>
  <li>Importing and optimizing existing artwork as sprites</li>
  <li>Creating game elements such as players, collectibles, obstacles, and enemies driven by basic AI. </li>
  <li>Using the tile editor</li>
  <li>Building a simple splash screen</li>
  <li>Connecting the game between two scenes</li>
</ul>

I've added a demonstration video below to show what I've done so far. You can visit the Super-Jetroid-Final directory to see the final version of the game.
